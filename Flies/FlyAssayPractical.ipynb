    "b) We anticipate ramping up this assay in the near future. We will have many files to parse instead of just one at a time. Let's refactor the code to process a single file into a function. Create a function called `processAssay` that takes one argument, a file name. This should return the line name and the average scores as a tuple: (line_name, average_score). Test it out by running it with scores.txt and with scores-dash.txt. Make sure you print out the result.\n",

    "c) Let's use the processAssay function you just wrote to process a list of files: ['assay1.txt', 'assay2.txt', 'assay3.txt', 'assay4.txt']. Process each one and print out the result. **HINT** You will need to use a loop."
